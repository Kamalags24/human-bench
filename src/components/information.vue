        <h2>Aim Trainer</h2>
        <p>Click the targets as quickly and accurately as you can.</p>
        <p>This tests reflexes and hand-eye coordination.</p>
        <p>Once you've clicked 30 targets, your score and average time per target will be displayed.</p>
        <p>Scores in this test are slower than the simple reaction time test, because you must react and then move the cursor.</p>
        <p>This test is best taken with a mouse or tablet screen. Trackpads are difficult to score well with.</p>
